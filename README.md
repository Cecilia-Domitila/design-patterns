OO Patterns

Strategy - Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithms vary independently from them clients that use them

Factory method - Defines an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory method lets a class defer instantiation to the subclasses

Singleton - Ensures a class only has one instance and provide a local point of access to it

Template Method - Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm structure
